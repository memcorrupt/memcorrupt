## Hey :wave:! I'm memcorrupt!

### :rocket: Introduction

You may be familiar with my username from various projects created throughout my teenage years that have consisted of:

- creating free and useful addons for online websites
- useful modifications or addons for games such as Minecraft and Roblox 
- various open-source projects I've released or contributed to
- companies I have founded

Throughout my programming experience since 2013, I have been proud of the countless hours spent creating software that has put smiles on many faces worldwide. :) 

<sub>*If you've had the chance to use any software I have made, you've been very impactful to my programming journey!*</sub>

### :dart: Current Focus

I'm currently leading the operations of [Luraph](https://lura.ph "Luraph - Online Lua Obfuscator"), an online Lua obfuscator allowing developers to secure their Lua scripts through virtualization based security. You can check out our opensource projects at @Luraph. We've been the industry leader since 2017, and focused on leading my team to push Lua obfuscation to further unprecedented levels.

Additionally, I am currently pursuing my B.S. **and** M.S. in Computer Science via an accelerated program at the university I attend.

When not actively engaged in one of those activities, I am usually engaged in R&D activities to solve extremely obscure problems to improve technology that I use in my professional or personal life.

I also currently enjoy DJing, listening to great music, driving IRL, and sim racing during my personal time.
